                        <p>Cikada is a versatile show for all ages which can be performed both outdoors and in indoor venues.</p>
                        
                        <p>The piece is an acrobatic and poetic reflection of the balance between the organic and the human. With high level acrobatics and a graceful, pedestrian movement quality, the piece is a fun, thoughtful and humorous display of rich imagery and dynamic, riveting movement.</p>
